# PHP FizzBuzz
This repository contains a classic PHP problem where it is necessary to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, while making an important substitution:
1. All multiples of the number 3 are replaced with the word "Fizz".
2. All multiples of the number 5 are replaced with the word "Buzz".
3. All multiples of the number 15 are replaced by the word "FizzBuzz".

This was done using a PHP while loop.
